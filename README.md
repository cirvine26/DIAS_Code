# DIAS_Code
Code written in my summer internship with the Dublin Institute for Advances Studies (DIAS) in 2020. The majority of the code relates to the simulation of spin-chain dynamics - including Monte Carlo simulations and Machine Learning for Quantum Control. Included is the paper I wrote in collaboration with the other interns highlighting our results.
